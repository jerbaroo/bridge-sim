** Installation

Currently two installation methods are provided. The Docker method is the easiest and will have you running some code as soon as possible. You can also clone this repository and run the source code directly. A Python package will be published on PyPI at some point, however hopefully one of the two available methods will suffice in the meantime.

*** tl;dr

If you have Docker installed and just want to get something runnning ASAP:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ docker run -it barischrooneyj/bridge-sim:v0.0.5
$ pipenv run python example.py
#+END_SRC

*** Docker

Make sure you have [[https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/][Docker]] installed.

Then in a terminal run the following to jump into a Docker image that already has all dependencies installed:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ docker run -it barischrooneyj/bridge-sim:v0.0.5
#+END_SRC

You are now in the =/bridge-sim= directory of the Docker container. You can run the provided example file =example.py= with ~pipenv run python example.py~. This will generate a file =/root/docker.png=.

To copy =docker.png= to your host system run the following commands in another terminal. The first command lists all running Docker containers. Copy the container ID and then use the ~docker cp~ command to copy =docker.png= to your host system.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                              COMMAND          CREATED             STATUS            PORTS     NAMES
d297a50ff165        barischrooneyj/bridge-sim:v0.0.5   "/bin/bash"      37 seconds ago      Up 37 seconds               vigorous_leavitt
$ docker cp d297a50ff165:/root/docker.png docker.png
#+END_SRC

To copy files to the =/root= directory of the Docker container you can run ~docker cp local-files/ d297a50ff165:/root~. Run ~docker cp --help~ or search the web for more information on Docker.

The Docker image that you enter with ~docker run~ has OpenSees installed at =/root/bin/OpenSees=. The =bridge-sim= source code along with all installed Python dependencies are in =/bridge-sim=. We have shown how to run the provided =example.py= file but you could modify this file and run a different example, some examples are given [[Examples][below]].

**** Lisa

These instructions may be useful if you are running simulations on the [[https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa][SURF SARA Lisa]] cluster or another system that supports [[https://sylabs.io/docs/#singularity][Singularity]].

Once you have SSHed into the Lisa cluster you can build a Singularity image of =bridge_sim= on Lisa with =singularity pull docker://barischrooneyj/bridge-sim:v0.0.5=. If the =pull= command fails or the generated =.sif= file is corrupted then try deleting the =.sif= file and run the =pull= command again.

To run a simulation you need a script to interact with the scheduler. See [[docker/run-lisa.sh][run-lisa.sh]] for an example of such a script and see the Lisa [[https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/lisa/user-guide/creating-and-running-jobs][user guide]] for further instructions. The way I use the =run-lisa.sh= script, is I configure scheduling parameters in the =run-lisa.sh= script but define my actual job in a second script [[docker/sim.sh][sim.sh]].

To view jobs in the queue I run =squeue | grep brjeremy=, where =brjeremy= is my username. Job output is saved in a =slurm-XXXXX.out= file where =XXXXX= is the job ID. I always delete the output from old jobs, so to delete the old output and run a new job I type =rm slurm*.out; sbatch run-lisa.sh=. Then the output can be viewed with =cat slurm-XXXXX.out=. To cancel a job run =scancel XXXXX=.

*** Directly

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. And also [[https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv][install Pipenv]]. Perhaps with ~pip install --user pipenv~?

You will need [[https://opensees.berkeley.edu/][OpenSees]], you can download it [[https://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/user/download.php][here]]. If installing OpenSees on Linux the top answer [[https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_to_install_opensees_in_UBUNTU][here]] may be of some help.

Clone this repository and change into the directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ git clone https://github.com/barischrooneyj/bridge-sim
$ cd bridge-sim
#+END_SRC

In the =bridge-sim= directory install project dependencies with ~pipenv install~. If you have an error and are on the Windows OS you may need to ~pipenv install pypiwin32~. I do not run Windows so can be of limited help there.

*** PyPI

A package is in the works.

** Introduction

A brief introduction to some of the Python classes provided. A =Bridge= describes the material properties, geometry and boundary conditions of a bridge. A =FEMRunner= is capable of transforming a =Bridge= along with some additional simulation parameters into a model file, running that file, and returning the responses from simulation. This project currently provides one instance of =FEMRunner= which is called =OSRunner= and is capable of running simulations with OpenSees. A =Config= contains some additional global configuration but is also used as a container for a =Bridge= and =FEMRunner=. This is useful because all three of these objects are required in many situations and combining them into one object makes life a bit easier than passing these three objects around separately.

# [[./data/images/config-composition.png]]

** Examples

If you have managed to install the software then the next step is to run an example such as /example.py/. You will need to make sure that OpenSees is on your PATH, if you have followed the Docker installation instructions then this is already done for you. The file /example.py/ can be run with =pipenv run python example.py=.

*** Point Load

Example bridge with a single point load applied.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from bridge_sim import bridges, configs, model, plot, sim

config = configs.opensees_default(bridges.bridge_narrow)
point_loads = [model.PointLoad(x=5, z=0, load=100)]
responses = sim.responses.load(config, model.RT.YTrans, point_loads)
plot.contour_responses(config, responses, point_loads)
plot.top_view_bridge(config, piers=True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

*** Static Vehicle

Example bridge with a 4-axled vehicle on it, each wheel is a point load.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from bridge_sim import bridges, configs, model, plot, sim, vehicle

config = configs.opensees_default(bridges.bridge_narrow, shorten_paths=True)
point_loads = vehicle.truck1.to_point_load_pw(
    time=3.5, bridge=config.bridge, list=True)
responses = sim.responses.load(config, model.RT.YTrans, point_loads)
plot.contour_responses(config, responses, point_loads)
plot.top_view_bridge(config, piers=True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

*** Pier Settlement

Wide bridge with two supporting piers, the first pier settled by 1.2 m.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from bridge_sim import bridges, configs, model, plot, sim

config = configs.opensees_default(bridges.bridge_wide)
responses = sim.responses.load(
    config,
    model.RT.YTrans,
    pier_settlement=[model.PierSettlement(0, 1.2)]
)
plot.contour_responses(config, responses)
plot.top_view_bridge(config, piers=True, lanes=True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

*** Different Response Types

Like the pier settlement example but plotting multiple response types.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from bridge_sim import bridges, configs, model, plot, sim

config = configs.opensees_default(bridges.bridge_wide)
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))
for subplot, response_type in enumerate([
        model.RT.YTrans, model.RT.ZTrans,
        model.RT.StrainXXB, model.RT.StrainZZB,
    ]):
    responses = sim.responses.load(
        config,
        response_type,
        pier_settlement=[model.PierSettlement(0, 1)],
    ).resize()
    plt.subplot(2, 2, subplot + 1)
    plot.contour_responses(config, responses)
    plot.top_view_bridge(config, piers=True, lanes=True)
    plt.title(response_type.name())

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

*** Custom Bridge

Like the first point-load example but with a really long and narrow bridge.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from bridge_sim import bridges, configs, model, plot, sim
from bridge_sim.bridges import Bridge, Lane, MaterialDeck, MaterialSupport, Support


def new_bridge():
    return Bridge(
        name="example",   # Name used to identify saved/loaded data.
        length=40,  # Length of this bridge.
        width=3,  # Width of this bridge.
        supports=[
            Support(
                x=20,  # X position of center of the support.
                z=0,  # Z position of center of the support.
                length=2,  # Length between support columns (X direction).
                height=2,  # Height from top to bottom of support.
                width_top=2,  # Width of support column at top (Z direction).
                width_bottom=1,  # Width of support column at bottom (Z direction).
                materials=[  # List of materials for the support columns.
                    MaterialSupport(
                        density=0.7,
                        thickness=0.7,
                        youngs=40000,
                        poissons=0.2,
                        start_frac_len=0,
                    )
                ],
                fix_z_translation=True,
                fix_x_translation=True,
            )
        ],
        # List of materials for the bridge deck.
        materials=[MaterialDeck(thickness=0.7, youngs=40000, poissons=0.2,)],
        # List of lanes where traffic can drive on the bridge.
        lanes=[Lane(-1, 1, True)],
    )

config = configs.opensees_default(new_bridge)
point_loads = [model.PointLoad(x=18, z=0, load=100)]
responses = sim.responses.load(config, model.RT.YTrans, point_loads)
plot.contour_responses(config, responses, point_loads)
plot.top_view_bridge(config, piers=True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

*** Custom Vehicle

Like the first static vehicle example, but this time with a custom vehicle.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from bridge_sim import bridges, configs, model, plot, sim
from bridge_sim.model import Vehicle

new_vehicle = Vehicle(
    # Load intensity of each axle.
    kn=[5000, 4000, 4000, 5000, 7000],
    # Distance between each pair of axles.
    axle_distances=[2, 2, 2, 1],
    # Width of each axle, distance between point loads.
    axle_width=2.5,
    # Speed of the vehicle.
    kmph=20,
)

config = configs.opensees_default(bridges.bridge_narrow, shorten_paths=True)
point_loads = new_vehicle.to_point_load_pw(time=3.5, bridge=config.bridge, list=True)
responses = sim.responses.load(config, model.RT.YTrans, point_loads)
plot.contour_responses(config, responses, point_loads)
plot.top_view_bridge(config, piers=True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
#+END_SRC
