* An extensible decision support system for bridge maintenance based on sensor data [[https://circleci.com/gh/barischrooneyj/thesis-msc-computational-science.svg?style=svg&circle-token=20fdf4442f5ec94ea46006e65a551c1cc304667c]]
  
My thesis for the University of Amsterdam and TNO.

Code is in [[code]] with a README describing the files [[./code/README.org][here]].

Supporting data is in [[data]].

PDFs and source files are in [[writing]], rendered thesis PDF [[./writing/thesis/thesis.pdf][here]].

** Quickstart

Ensure that [[https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/][pipenv]] and Python 3.7 are installed on your system. Instructions for
installing pipenv can be found [[https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv][here]].

You'll also need [[https://opensees.berkeley.edu/][OpenSees]] on your system, which can you download from [[https://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/user/download.php][here]]

Then clone this repository and change into the directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone git@github.com:barischrooneyj/bridge-dss
cd bridge-dss
#+END_SRC bash

Open the file [[code/config_sys.py]] and ensure that =Config.os_exe_path= points
to the OpenSees executable installed on your system.

Then install Python dependencies and activate the Python environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
#+END_SRC

Finally run this script to create some plots using the low accuracy "debug"
model of bridge 705 in Amsterdam:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./scripts/make-all.sh --clean --debug --3d
#+END_SRC

Resulting plots are found in the directory [[generated-data-debug-images]].
