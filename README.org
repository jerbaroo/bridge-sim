** Quickstart

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then [[https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv][install Pipenv]].

You also need [[https://opensees.berkeley.edu/][OpenSees]], you can download it [[https://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/user/download.php][here]].

Clone this repository and change into the directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone git@github.com:barischrooneyj/bridge-sim  # or https://github.com/barischrooneyj/bridge-sim
cd bridge-sim
#+END_SRC bash

Open the Python file ~code/config_sys.py~ with a text editor and ensure that =Config.os_exe_path= points
to the OpenSees executable installed on your system.

Install project dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

#+END_SRC

Now either explore the CLI or browse the notebooks:
