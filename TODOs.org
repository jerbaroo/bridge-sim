* Todo List
** TODO [#A] Validate temperature load
- For the same simulation, the vertical translation is in excellent agreement.
- Therefore the error must be in the post-processing?
- Still, can try with higher amount of nodes.
  - Abs. diff. in max and min might increase.
  - Abs. diff. was 0.5579 for MSL = 0.4 (full mesh).
  - Abs. diff. in AxisVM is 0.6
- Results:
  - AxisVM: min -0.26 max 0.34

** TODO [#C] Stress vs. tensile strength
- Calculate if stress > strength
  - Tensile stress is defined as the force per unit area induced in the body in
    response to externally applied force, which tends to elongate or stretch the
    body.
  - Concrete is weak in tension but strong in compression.
  - The range for the tensile strength of concrete is about 2.2 - 4.2 MPa. For
    low strength class concrete, as mentioned by Saber, the tensile strength of
    unreinforced concrete equals 1/10 the compressive strength, and for higher
    class, it is about 1/15. A good reference where this is mentioned is the
    book by S U Pillai "Reinforced Concrete Design" (ISBN: 9780070141100).

CLOSED: [2019-10-22 Tue 11:40]
- First one (end of November) is about thesis direction. Goal is to have model
  (A) first half mostly done and written about and (B) classification started.

  work necessary on inputs e.g. noise and (B) pre-release draft of the thesis.
**** DONE I want to work towards the meeting.
CLOSED: [2019-10-22 Tue 11:40]
- The getting events from 3D model is almost done
- You saw the load/vehicle refactor last week

  are model discrepancies the model behaviour seems to look right but shifted,
  thus classification on current responses will also work on adjusted responses.
- Let's book the meeting
- I'll work toward a presentation and closing current milestones
- TODO: set up traffic scenario where total load on the bridge for dense traffic
  is greater than the load with an abnormal heavy wehnicle on the bridge (sparse

- Mesh refinement should clear up variance
- Need to add nodes where material properties change
- Try without change in material properties to see if it's due to material
  property alignment
- Try repeat run to see if numerical noise is cause fo variance
**** TODO What to store in terms of traffic & responses
- 24 hours of normal traffic, varying intensity
- @ 250Hz, 1 minute is 60 * 250 * 4 * 100 * 8 ~= 48 MB

***** TODO Why is strain = CTE * deltaT? Check the units.
**** TODO Why consider temperature difference from the top and bottom?
How does that correspond to a change in January to July?
- Due to the sun heating from the top.
**** TODO AxisVM questions.
Record screen.
***** TODO Which type of distributed load
***** TODO Change size of distributed load
***** TODO Add displacement load
***** TODO Difference in rigid link and line support?
***** TODO Check and modify material property
*** Meeting early January
**** TODO print and show draft
Key things:
- validate piers
- validate temperature
- comparison to dynamic 705 time series
- use viaduct data
- iterate on classification experiments
**** TODO go over experiments

**** TODO [#C] Timing plot of OpenSees
**** DONE [#A] Find out why simulation is not saving all
CLOSED: [2019-10-14 Mon 13:11]
It was because z-translation responses were not being converted.
**** DONE [#A] Find out why simulation is not saving z-translation
CLOSED: [2019-10-14 Mon 13:11]
It was because z-translation responses were not being converted.

**** DONE [#A] Mesh improvements
CLOSED: [2019-10-20 Sun 13:44] DEADLINE: <2019-10-18 Fri>
- Base mesh for bridge deck and bridge piers.
- Ensure pier nodes are part of deck and vice versa.
- Ensure load position had a perfectly placed node.
**** DONE [#B] Model assumptions
CLOSED: [2019-10-21 Mon 09:28]
**** BLOCKED [#A] Collect stresses and strains
- Waiting on Arpi to respond with method.
**** TODO [#B] Check OpenSees 3D IL plots
- Contour plots look correct so it is hopefully a small bug.
- Before collecting results improve mesh.
- Need to verify against the contour plots.
- Increase model density and see when it breaks.
**** INPROGRESS [#C] 3D Events from ILs
- Plotting the events from 3D FEM
- Traffic scenarios updated for multi-lane traffic
**** DONE [#C] OpenSees single section deck and piers
CLOSED: [2019-10-20 Sun 19:27]
**** TODO [#C] Additional contour plots from Axis
- Need to go over the model and ensure it's correct.
- Positions chosen, then need to collect the results.
**** TODO [#C] Additional contour plots from Diana
- Positions chosen, now need to collect the results.
