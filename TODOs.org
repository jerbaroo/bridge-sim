* Meetings
** 8th October
*** TODO I'll go over some things quick, looking for short responses, then open floor
*** TODO Quickly show contour plot, has updated sections, check pier values (later TODO)
*** TODO Deck and pier sections are given as lists, can use functino to create the list
*** TODO Sent Valeria big update on Friday, will follup with sections/subsections, was a good work week
*** TODO Show some key points
*** TODO Will update thesis document with sections/subsections/plots/assumptions
*** TODO Second milestone finished this week (KISS), but 3D model won't have high node density
*** TODO Cloud of nodes plot
*** TODO Biggest modeling assumptions are vehicles move on tracks and at constant speed
*** TODO Added max_shell_area argument
*** TODO Reason convergence plot doesn't work is load doesn't line up with nodes
*** TODO NOTE: Once basic writing is added should start writing on bridges/costs
*** TODO Will be away a bit this week but will still get it done
*** TODO When are TNO open over winter break/when is the break?
*** TODO Haskell-like syntax to describe Python model/pseudocode?
*** TODO Remove interpolation code
*** TODO Who would know about amount of npnp concrete slab bridges?
*** TODO Keep Diana code
*** TODO Check pier values
*** TODO Go over units in OpenSees file and Python classes
*** TODO Go over fixed nodes in OpenSees
*** TODO Go over Axis modeling
*** TODO Comments in 3D .tcl file
