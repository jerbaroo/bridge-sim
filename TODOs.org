*** DONE Two meetings organized with Valeria
CLOSED: [2019-10-22 Tue 11:40]
- First one (end of November) is about thesis direction. Goal is to have model
  (A) first half mostly done and written about and (B) classification started.
- Second one end of the year, my goal is to have (A) finished first half, more
  work necessary on inputs e.g. noise and (B) pre-release draft of the thesis.
*** DONE I want to work towards the meeting.
CLOSED: [2019-10-22 Tue 11:40]
- The getting events from 3D model is almost done
- You saw the load/vehicle refactor last week
- Let's set a milestone for first classification for Friday. Even though there
  are model discrepancies the model behaviour seems to look right but shifted,
  thus classification on current responses will also work on adjusted responses.
- Let's book the meeting
- I'll work toward a presentation and closing current milestones
- TODO: set up traffic scenario where total load on the bridge for dense traffic
  is greater than the load with an abnormal heavy wehnicle on the bridge (sparse
  traffic)

- House agreed on sleeping hours 9 - 5
- Started exercising, good for stress
*** TODO Go over 2 months plan
- At a high level
  - Some classification work, earlier in the 2 months
  - Lots of writing, writing-driven appoach
  - Finish model inputs and collecting outputs
    - inputs: pier displacement, temperature, soil creep, noise, light vehicles
