** 21st October
*** TODO Mesh update
- Base mesh arguments
- Grid and pier connected together
- Additional mesh position from load
- Removes a point of unconfidence in the model
*** TODO Plot's of nodes sections and deck/pier only
- Allows for debugging the model
- Pier colors are unchanging
- Transverse direction the deck seems to not be mirrored along the middle
*** TODO The 3D OS FEM has a single section option, printed at runtime.
*** TODO I chose the plotting points for verification
- There are 4, let's have a look
- 3 are chosen to be on traffic lanes
- Should be adjusted to be on points in Diana model
  TODO: Add plot per wheel track
*** TODO Two meetings organized with Valeria
- First one (end of November) is about thesis direction. Goal is to have model
  (A) first half mostly done and written about and (B) classification started.
- Second one end of the year, my goal is to have (A) finished first half, more
  work necessary on inputs e.g. noise and (B) pre-release draft of the thesis.
*** TODO I want to work towards the meeting.
- The getting events from 3D model is almost done
- You saw the load/vehicle refactor last week
- Let's set a milestone for first classification for Friday. Even though there
  are model discrepancies the model behaviour seems to look right but shifted,
  thus classification on current responses will also work on adjusted responses.
- Let's book the meeting
- I'll work toward a presentation and closing current milestones
- TODO: set up traffic scenario where total load on the bridge for dense traffic
  is greater than the load with an abnormal heavy wehnicle on the bridge (sparse
  traffic)
*** TODO Can we have another meeting later this week
*** TODO I want to go over Diana and Axis now
