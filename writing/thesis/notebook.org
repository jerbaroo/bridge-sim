** DONE Initial timeline
    CLOSED: [2019-04-24 Wed 10:54]
    I suggest:
    - 1 week background reading.
    - 1 week to come up with a question.
    - 4 weeks, focus on: generating synthetic data, data analysis and consider
      high-risk sections of the project.
    - 6 weeks building, iterating and analysing core models and data required to
      answer the research question.
    - After three months we have the core of the system such that we can at
      least partly answer the research question. Further work will be on
      analysis and improvements to the system in the context of answering the
      research question in as much detail as possible.
* Questions
** TODO What types of damage can occur on bridge 705?
** TODO Can abnormal status be detected using SSSB?
** TODO What is the minimal and the optimal sensor placement?
** TODO What are the limitations (including uncertainty) of such a system?
** TODO What are the costs and benefits associated with such a system?
** TODO Can sensor data reduce the cost of maintenance checks?
** TODO How do sensor type and position affect abnormal condition classification?
** TODO What is the minimum sensor density needed for this system to operate?
** TODO What is necessary to adapt the system from one bridge to another?
     How much structure specific information is necessary for a useful system?
** DONE What is the point of an infuence line?
   CLOSED: [2019-06-06 Thu 10:20]
   An influence line shows the response of the bridge at each point for a load
   at a point A. A unit weight is driven along the bridge and the simulated
   sensor measurement collected at each point. Due to the superposition property
   the influence line can be used to determine the response of the bridge for
   other loads.
** DONE What is the use of synthetic data?
    #+NAME: use-of-synthetic-data
    CLOSED: [2019-05-07 Tue 10:47]
    Collecting sensor data under normal conditions allows for the training of a
    one class classifier. In some cases this data will not be available,
    therefore it is necessary to generate the data, this addresses the
    cold-start problem. In the case of bridge 705 we verify our synthetic data
    against real data to show it is viable to begin training with synthetic data
    in cases where the real data is not available. The synthetic data will also
    be useful when moving beyond a one class classifier, and attempting to
    estimate damage.
** DONE How can we collect sensor data under normal conditions?
   CLOSED: [2019-06-06 Thu 10:28]
   Use a finite element model to simulate sensor measurements under normal
   loading conditions (determined from data). These simulated sensor
   measurements represent the range of sensor measurments under normal
   conditions. That the simulated sensor measurements reflect reality can be
   verified against the sensor measurements obtained through experiments.
* Meetings
** May 6 with Arpi
*** What is the use of synthetic data?
    Answered in [[use-of-synthetic-data]]
*** What is a good way of collecting strain data?
    Need to collect a point at every fiber.
*** Detect abnormalities by classifying similar substructures together.
    This idea is based on the presumption that similar substructures should
    behave in a similar manner, as soon as sensors in one substructure are
    operating differently this is an indication that something has gone wrong.
    This also means that sensors on different substructures should be placed in
    the same relative places.
*** Abnormalities could be detected with NC, time-series and similar substructures?
    Probably not with time series, but the other two are worth investigating.
*** What should be done next on the OpenSees model?
    Collect better strain information. 
*** Could evolutionary algorithms be used to determine sensor placement?
    The optimal sensor placement depends on the definition of optimal, what are
    we trying to maximise? If we are trying to maximise the amount of sensory
    information, then we should cover all available space on the bridge with
    sensors, but clearly we also need to put a cost term into the evaluation
    function.
*** What are the damage scenarios for bridge 705?
*** English document on bridge 705.
    Meeting with Diego Wednesday morning.
*** Additional Feedback
    Ask for help about the data collection, last slide.
** June 3 with Arpi
*** Difference between nominal and true strain
*** What is the usefulness of the influence line
    Overview of method:
    - Determine normal loading conditions (NLC)
    - Generate sensor responses from model based on the NLC
    - Verify sensor responses from sensor measurements
    - Determine responses as normal/abnormal from a neural cloud
    - We have ignored: sensor positioning, similar substructures, decision
      support system
*** How to extract moment diagram and influence line from OpenSees
*** TNO password
*** Go over timeline
*** How to interface with Diana

** Unfiled
   The risk of a false negative is higher for suggesting a bridge should receive
   a maintenance check than for predicting a bridge will suffer failure. We will
   examine the influence on the uncertainty of our damage estimate and the
   associated risk as we vary parameters of our model. Of particular interest is
   the increased risk of a false negative ncluding the threshold from low damage
   requiring a maintenance check to high damage indicating the bridge is close
   to failure.
   
   # Feasability.
   Our system, consisting of sensors and associated software, must clearly be
   cost-effective for it to be used. Therefore we estimate the required impact
   of such a system on a real-life situation, parameters of such a situation
   include the amount of sensors, codes/requirements for maintenance checks.

* Reading & Read
** 2019: Physics-informed neural network: A deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations
    The key point in this paper is that when enough data is not available for a
    deep learning solution, then some law of physics can be included in the
    error function.
** 2019: Probabilistic system indentification and optimal sensor placement for a single anchored sheet pile wall
    Xuzheng worked on system identification (parameter inference) of a single
    anchored sheet pile wall from sensor data. A FE model with input parameters
    of the retaining wall gives a distribution of the observed parameters. The
    input (or hidden) parameters are then determined with some uncertainty from
    the observations. Sensor placement is optimised by minimizing the credible
    region and entropy from the sensor readings.
