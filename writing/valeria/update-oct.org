Hi Valeria, here's a little update for you. It begins with the introduction
taken from the thesis. Then a little overview of some results. Then a breakdown
of the time and work. I have included some questions for you, highlighted, and
other parts may be highlighted. I am not sure if you have replied to Arpad's
doodle for a meeting, but I believe you should have been sent an invite, let me
know if you havn't received it.

This week's work has been going well, it is such a relief to have a quiet home
to come home to, I worked until 4am on Sunday night and am happy to work as much
as I can. When I have the right environment I really enjoy my work, but when the
environment isn't right I can't focus (I can't even work in the "silent room" on
our floor of TNO without my noise cancelling headphones because there is a
ticking noise in the corner).

I am away for a weekend in October (to see a patron). And I will be away for a
weekend for Christmas, will keep it short. I talked to the study advisor and she
is happy to gave me an extension until the end of February, and she said if I
want another extension that is fine too.

I am quite optimistic and motivated for this thesis, and would really appreciate
your opinion on the stuff below, in particular your comments on the work and
effort sections at the end of this document.

Also would you mind if I sent you a document outlining in as much detail as I
can the sections and subsections of the thesis next week? Because sometimes I am
unsure if something is results/methods.

* Thesis Introduction
  
* Work
  
- Developed an extensible system for generating synthetic data from bridges
  under different bridge damage scenarios and different traffic conditions.
- The system has as parameter a bridge, bridge 705 is a parameter for this
  thesis, specifications come from the Diana model. This allows for not just
  bridge 705 to be analyzed, but any no pre-stress no post-tensions concrete
  slab bridge, which are most bridges I believe.
- The system has as parameter an interface to a finite element program
  =FEMRunner=, in this thesis the only instance of this interface is targeting
  OpenSees, =OSRunner=. Work was done toward collection of data from the finite
  element program Diana for bridge 705 but that was scrapped as I am going for
  the open source FE program OpenSees to generate 3D results, thus if the
  interface to Diana had remained it would only be useful to collect results
  from an existing an Diana model (like bridge 705) under different traffic
  conditions.
- When we last talked only the 2D OpenSees model existed, the responses/bridge
  animations you saw were collected from that, the idea was that this "light"
  model would be used for quick collection of results (Diana is slooooow) and to
  compare how a "light" model compares to a "good" model.
- Now I am using both 2D and 3D OpenSees models, the 3D model is being verified
  against models of bridge 705 in Diana and Axis. So the system supports 2D and
  3D definitions of a bridge, for fast/slow data collection. And I can do a
  comparison of the quality/timing difference of the added dimension. 2D is
  about 1 second, 3D takes a few minutes. You can see the nodes of the generated
  FEM for bridge 705 in Figure [[fig:cloud-of-nodes]].
- While developing the programmatic OpenSees FEM it is useful to validate the
  model built so far against a model in which there is some confidence, useful
  because it is not necessary to build the entire model before validation can
  occur. AxisVM allows for rapid building of FEMs via a GUI and inspection of
  the properties of the model and the responses from loading. The GUI in AxisVM
  allowed for the manual validation of a model of bridge 705. The AxisVM model
  was used to validate the OS 3D FEM during development, see contour plots of
  responses below.

  In Figure [[fig:axis]] and [[fig:os]] you can see contour plots of loading from the
  AxisVM and OpenSees programmes, a bit more work needs to be done on the
  OpenSees model, before it is like the Diana one, namely the boundary
  conditions of the model (fixed nodes on supports and ends of the bridge deck)
  need to be set correctly, I have added the functionality to the system that
  generates the OpenSees model for setting how each support is set, and I am
  going to get the varying thickness of the piers and the deck tonight.
- The system allows for collection of "events" where an event is a time series
  of responses from one sensor under one simulation, at a certain frequency e.g.
  250 Hz. It is really easy to request existing events or make new events under
  certain scenarios, or for example to request existing events from different
  sensors for the same simulation. Events can be collected under different
  =Trigger= s, this feature will likely go unused, a trigger says when to start
  or stop recording (perhaps due to some response threshold), currently only the
  =always_trigger=, which is always firing, is used. A stream of raw responses
  from a simulation are converted to a list of events, under some =Trigger=,
  using a =Recorder=, this could theoretically be hooked up to a stream of
  responses received via a HTTP server e.g. receiving live data. When we talked
  last I thought to have events be triggered by some condition/trigger as is
  done in one paper (Sydney Harbour Bridge (SHB)), but due to the high rate of
  traffic and that responses are possibly more localized in SHB, there will
  likely always be events triggered, hence always colelcting events. To avoid
  responses being split into two events at some time T where the split causes
  some useful feature for identification to be split in half, there is thus some
  overlap between events, see below:
- A bridge specification/input looks something like that below, I am using
  Haskell syntax here for writing down the bridge specification (Haskell has a
  nice syntax for describing data).

* Effort
  
Can you confirm you are happy with the overview of the thesis components in the
table below, or that it is sufficient?

Is there anything you would particularly like to see?

Is there anything glaringly obvious missing? (I am particularly interested in an
answer to this question) (I know that it is really important I need to write
down all the modeling assumptions [how traffic scenarios/bridge 705/damage
scenarios are modeled.])

| Data model      | Standard toolbox | There is a standard toolbox of classifier that should be tested, there are a number of different things to try here, can outline in person.                                               |
| Data model      | Calibration      | If using MLP or similar calibrate/parameter tune for best performance.                                                                                                                    |

| Cost/benefit    | -                | This section largely motivates the work done, why it's useful etc, it is non-practical (little to no code) but a lot of writing/research.                                                 |

I have left out some detail on the "Data model" section. There are a lot of
relatively obvious things to try here, different classifiers, try to classify
any deviation from the normal state, try to classify specific scenarios, try to
detect location of damage, try combinations of models. What is the effect of
increasing noise on classification (read: is it worth to buy more expensive
sensors)? What is the effect on varying bridge parameters e.g.
width/length/number of supports? What is the effect of the amount of sensors
(these have an associated installation cost in real-life) on classification?

You can read the 4 sections in the table above as answering the questions:

FE model/system: "I need a model to generate data to analyze"

Inputs/data: "I need to specify the data I want e.g. a bridge / a damage
scenario / a traffic scenario"

Data model: "I need to analyze the data generated by a FE model using a
data-driven model"

Cost/benefit: "why is this all useful at all?"

Can you confirm you are happy with the approximate breakdown of the thesis in the table below, or that it is sufficient?

| (Extensible) FE model & data collection system (includes verified bridge 705 model)                                                  |     40 |      30 |
| Data-driven model                                                                                                                    |     40 |      45 |
| Inputs/data                                                                                                                          |      5 |       5 |
| Cost/benefit (applicability to different bridge types/cost & benefit of implmentation in real life/what other techniques could work) |     15 |      20 |

The FE model & data collection system and inputs/data have a lot done. The
remaining 4/5 months will be mostly on the data model and cost/benefit.
