#+TITLE: January Meeting

* December
- Made progress, will fly through plots
- Started with rebuilding 3D model
  - previous model: crap convergence
- Milestone: draft by end of this month
- Quit work
* Plots
* Milestone: 31st January
- Thermal loading validated (difficult)
- Pier settlement validated (difficult)
- Classifier++ (difficult)
- Draft (medium)
- Light vehicle data (1 day)
- Compare time series from 3D & 2D model (easy)
- Compare time series to dynamic test (???)
  - had meeting planned before xmas
* Questions
- Why is strain = curvature mode shape?
- Why does density have no effect on simulation?
- Comparison of strain and displacment/acceleration mode shapes
    Recently, many researchers have demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of
    measuring strain mode shape with the help of strain gauges instead of measuring
    acceleration or displacement mode shape [ 10-121.

- Debug piers and temperature?
