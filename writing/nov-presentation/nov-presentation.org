* Actual November
- Writing
- Pier displacement in 3D
- Speed up response calculation
  - Traffic (vehicle) sampling *much* faster
  - Response to traffic via matrix multiplication
- Collect distribution of responses
- Quantify distribution of responses
- Verification
  - Plot for each displacement sensor
  - Regression plots
  - Convergence plot
* December: Overview
- Writing
- Fully verified

(In other words: free up Jan/Feb for classification!)
