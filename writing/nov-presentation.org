#+TITLE: 27th November

* Vehicles
* November Plan
| Week 1 | Writing             | +Sensor cost emails/research+ |
| Week 2 | Writing             | Try standard classifiers      |
| Week 3 | Verification plot 1 | Collect strain                |
| Week 4 | Verification plot 2 | Classifiers                   |
* Actual November
- Writing
- Pier displacement
- Speed up response calculation
  - Traffic (vehicle) sampling *much* faster
  - Response to traffic via matrix multiplication
- Collect distribution of responses
- Quantify distribution of responses
- Verification
  - Plot for each displacement sensor
  - Regression plots
  - Convergence plot
* December
| Goal                                       | Note                      |
|--------------------------------------------+---------------------------|
| Strain verified                            |                           |
| Pier displacement verified                 | Against AxisVM            |
| Add temperature to model                   | "Noise" in classification |
| Add cracked concrete to model              | Small change (change =E=) |
| Another better classification example      |                           |
| Mesh refinement, obery material properties | Improves model accuracy   |
| Mesh refinement, more dense around load    | Improves model accuracy   |
| Choose number of unit load simulations     | Parameter selection       |
| Parallelization                            | 14days -> 4days           |
| 20k good words (12k current, 10k good)     | Pre-alpha draft           |
