* November Plan
| Week 1 | Writing             | +Sensor cost emails/research+ |
| Week 2 | Writing             | Try standard classifiers      |
| Week 3 | Verification plot 1 | Collect strain                |
| Week 4 | Verification plot 2 | Classifiers                   |
* Actual November
- Writing
- Pier displacement in 3D
- Speed up response calculation
  - Traffic (vehicle) sampling *much* faster
  - Response to traffic via matrix multiplication
- Collect distribution of responses
- Quantify distribution of responses
- Verification
  - Plot for each displacement sensor
  - Regression plots
  - Convergence plot
* December (1/2)
- Writing
- Fully verified

(In other words: free up Jan/Feb for classification!)
* December (2/2)
| Goal                                      | Note                      |
|-------------------------------------------+---------------------------|
| Strain verified (5th Dec)                 | Post-processing step      |
| Pier displacement verified (5th Dec)      | Against AxisVM            |
| Mesh refinement, obey material properties | Improves model accuracy   |
| Mesh refinement, more dense around load   | Improves model accuracy   |
| Parallelization                           | 14days -> 4days           |
| Choose number of unit load simulations    | Parameter selection       |
| Add temperature to model                  | "Noise" in classification |
| Add cracked concrete to model             | Small change (change =E=) |
| Writing on classification                 | Experiment setup          |
| 20k good words (12k current, 10k good)    | Pre-alpha draft           |
