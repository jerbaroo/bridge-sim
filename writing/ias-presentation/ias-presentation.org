#+TITLE: Bridge DSS
#+AUTHOR: Jeremy Barisch-Rooney

* Research Question
What are the costs and benefits of installing a decision support system (DSS)
based on real-time sensor data, for the purpose of bridge maintenance, on a
no-prestress no-postension concrete slab bridge?

* Key goals
- Verified extensible FEM
- System : (bridge model, inputs) -> events
- Anomaly detection
- Avoid detecting low frequency events
* Anything missing?
- Comparison of 2D/3D FEM responses
- Comparison to another bridge
* Reproducible
- I should be maintainer after the thesis
  - I care about open source
  - I care about maintainability & usability
  - I know the code best
- Licence
  - GPL (sharing improvements)
* My Goals
- Create something TNO appreciate
- Create something used
  - Usable -> Useful -> Used
* Muchas Gracias
* Future collaboration
- Don't start thesis until long-term housing is found
- TNO could ask about reserving a student room
  - Perhaps for semeter start
  - Low effort, high potential
