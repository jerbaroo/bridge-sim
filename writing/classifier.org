* Pairwise map
- The same vehicles drive over all sensors on one lane of a bridge.
- In other words: all sensors on one lane are subjected to equal vehicle loading.
- Use this knowledge to compare sensors on one lane for detecting damage.
- Only one lane because traffic on lanes may differ, e.g. in/outbound.
- Assumption: vehicle's speed will not change much over a short bridge.
- Assumption: traffic configuration will not change much over the bridge.
- Limiting to one lane: will not detect damage that affects half of a bridge.
** Pairwise maps: over time
- Relative change of sensors to other sensors over time.
- The pairwise map compares sensors to each other, thus if damage were to affect
  the entire bridge equally then there would be no change in the pairwise map
  after the damage. However damage affecting the entire bridge equally seems
  unlikely, furthermore it is a false negative rather than a false positive.
- Temperature may affect the entire bridge, but temperature is not damage, and
  not something to be detected.
- Temperature may affect parts of a bridge more than others due to orientation
  of the bridge and position of the sun in the sky. To combat environmental
  factors that affect the bridge unequally, the pairwise map should be compared
  at time intervals that are short enough not to be significantly affected by
  such environmental factors.
- If the time interval for comparing pairwise maps was very short e.g. 5s then
  the vehicles passing one sensor in one time interval would be different to
  the vehicles passing another sensor in the same time interval.
- In order to combat noise, the sensor data should have outliers removed before
  calculation of the pairwise map.
- In order to facilitate the comparison of pairwise maps, each pairwise map
  should be normalized to the same interval. This is because the traffic
  intensity and load may be different at different times.
*** TODO: Combine pairwise maps with machine learning.
*** TODO: Consider feature used for quantifying difference between sensors.
** Pairwise maps: at a point in time
- Compare sensors at equal positions in a substructure at a point in time.
- The previous technique requires damage to occur during recording of sensor
  data but cannot detect existing damage. On the SHB: existing damage was
  accurately detected by creating a pairwise map from sensors that were located
  on similar substructures.
- Makes the assumption unequal environmental affects will not be too noisy.
- Technique will work better with a larger amount of similar substructures.
- Manual selection of the similar substructures on one lane.
- Compare data per substructure to every other substructure, if one is
  significantly different to the rest then damage is likely.
** TODO: Use a damage sensitive feature, perhaps mean event acceleration?
* Detecting cracks
- Consider an uncracked bridge.
- Collect difference between neighbouring pairs of responses.
- Feature could be the difference in acceleration.
* OCSVM trained on healthy data.
- Show comparison to SVM trained on labeled data.
* PSO for sensor positioning.
